1. Encryption and Email Security

Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

It is one of the simplest and earliest encryption methods used in classical cryptography.

In Kleopatra, encryption ensures message confidentiality using public/private key pairs.

Decryption in Kleopatra uses the recipient’s private key to recover the original message.

Email encryption ensures secure communication and prevents unauthorized access to message content.

2. Decryption and Keylogger Attack

Caesar Cipher decryption shifts characters in the opposite direction of encryption.

It restores the original plaintext from the encrypted text using the same key value.

A keylogger records keystrokes typed on a keyboard, often used for monitoring or stealing information.

Keylogger attacks can capture passwords, credit card details, or confidential messages.

Protection involves using antivirus software and avoiding untrusted downloads.

3. Rail Fence and Product Cipher

Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that writes text in zigzag form and reads it row-wise.

It rearranges letters without changing them, improving secrecy through pattern change.

A Product Cipher combines two or more ciphers (like substitution and transposition).

Using Rail Fence as part of a product cipher increases encryption complexity.

Such combined methods form the basis for modern cryptographic algorithms.

4. Caesar Decryption, SHA-512 & AES-CBC-128

Caesar Cipher decryption reverses the shift applied during encryption.

SHA-512 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 512-bit (64-byte) output.

Hashing ensures data integrity by detecting any modification in the input.

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for data security.

AES-CBC-128 mode uses a 128-bit key and an initialization vector (IV) to provide strong confidentiality.

5. Brute Force, SHA-256 & AES-CBC-256

A brute force attack tries all possible keys to decrypt encrypted text until it finds the correct one.

It is time-consuming but guarantees finding the correct key eventually.

SHA-256 hashing produces a 256-bit output and is used to ensure message integrity.

AES-CBC-256 uses a 256-bit key for stronger encryption security.

CBC mode adds randomness through the IV, preventing pattern-based attacks.

6. Product Cipher & AES-ECB-256

A product cipher combines multiple encryption techniques to increase strength.

Applying Rail Fence on Caesar Cipher output mixes substitution and transposition for higher complexity.

AES-ECB mode encrypts each block independently, which can reveal patterns in data.

AES-ECB-256 uses a 256-bit key, offering strong but less secure pattern protection compared to CBC.

ECB mode is usually avoided for large or patterned data due to its predictability.

7. Product Cipher (Caesar) & Network Analysis

Applying Caesar Cipher on encrypted text adds an additional encryption layer.

Finding an IP address (like google.com) helps identify the server location.

Traceroute determines the number of hops (routers) between source and destination.

Port scanning reveals which communication ports are open on a server.

Tools like ping, traceroute, and nmap are used for network and port analysis.

8. Digital Signature

A digital signature ensures authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of a message.

It uses the sender’s private key for signing and the public key for verification.

Any modification in data after signing invalidates the signature.

Digital signatures are commonly used in secure email and document authentication.

They rely on public key infrastructure (PKI) for trust and validation.

9. RSA Encryption and Decryption

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm using two keys — public and private.

The public key encrypts data, and the private key decrypts it.

It is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

RSA ensures confidentiality and authentication in communication.

It is widely used in SSL/TLS, digital signatures, and secure key exchange.

10. Password Attack & File Integrity

A password attack attempts to crack or guess user passwords through various methods.

Network commands can help identify suspicious IPs or unauthorized access attempts.

File integrity checking ensures files have not been altered or corrupted.

Tools like diff, md5sum, or sha help verify file integrity.

Maintaining logs helps trace the attacker and identify compromised systems.

11. HTTP & HTTPS Analysis

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used to inspect data packets in real time.

HTTP transmits data in plaintext, making it less secure.

HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS, ensuring secure communication.

HTTPS handshake involves certificate exchange and key negotiation.

HTTPS protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

12. Network Analysis Using PuTTY

PuTTY is a terminal emulator used to connect to remote machines via SSH or Telnet.

Open ports indicate active network services available for communication.

Port scanning identifies which services are running on a system.

Common ports include 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH), and 443 (HTTPS).

Network analysis helps assess security posture and detect vulnerabilities.

13. Keylogger, AES-CBC-256 & Rail Fence Decryption

A keylogger records user keystrokes to capture sensitive data.

AES-CBC-256 provides strong encryption using a 256-bit key and an IV for randomness.

Decryption restores original data using the same key and IV.

Rail Fence decryption reconstructs the original message from its zigzag pattern.

Layered encryption and decryption help protect data from unauthorized access.

14. Digital Certificate

A digital certificate authenticates the identity of a user or organization.

It is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to establish trust.

It contains the public key, organization details, and validity period.

Digital certificates are used in SSL/TLS for secure web communication.

They ensure that data is exchanged only with verified and trusted entities.

15. Phishing Link Analysis

A phishing link is designed to trick users into revealing personal or financial information.

Such links often mimic legitimate websites to appear trustworthy.

Analyzing the URL, domain, and SSL certificate helps detect phishing attempts.

Phishing attacks compromise user credentials and financial data.

Always verify URLs and avoid clicking unknown or suspicious links.
